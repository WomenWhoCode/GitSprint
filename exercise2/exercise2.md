1) Create a new Rails project named ex2

2) start to track the entire code(hints: git add, git commit)

3) Modify files and commit them with message "2nd Commit"

4) Modify files and commit them with message "3rd Commit"

5) Now create a branch named "happy-branch"

6) Go into that branch

7) Do a git log and check what you see?

8) Modify more files and commit them with message "4th commit"

9)and now do a git log

10) go back to master

11) do a git log and discuss what you see

12) merge your branch onto master

13) see the command line what happened?

14) Now push your changes onto github on master( May be you need a repo on github and you will need to add the remote )

15) Create a new branch name "mostly-happy" from master and switch to  that branch

16) modify some files and commit them

17) push your branch "mostly-happy" onto your remote ( donot push to master. you need to push to the branch on remote )

18) switch back to master

19) make some changes in master and commit them

20) now switch back to "mostly-happy"

21) do a rebase master and look at your command line on what git told you

22) Go back to master and merge "mostly-happy" onto master

23) do you know there is another way to get the changes of "mostly-happy" onto master without rebasing?(well I dont recommend that)
